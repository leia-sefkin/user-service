* A User rest Resource that allows clients to create, read, update, delete a user or a list of users.
* You can use a database of your choice but it's also fine to just use a map or dictionary in memory to keep track of users by their ids.
* Use structured logging
* Add Metrics (such as dropwizard, codahale, or prometheus to time routes)
* Write unit tests for the service.
* Generate a code coverage report (for Java you can use the jacoco-maven-plugin for unit test coverage).
* The user JSON can just be id, first name, last name, zip code, and email address.
